# Who am I?

I am a software engineer with a passion for building things. I consider myself a fast learner and a team player. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow.

I am a big fan of open source and I'm looking forward to working with Rust and Kubernetes.

In my free time I like to do Acroyoga and Acroduo.

# Culture

I believe that the best way to learn is by doing, and the best way to teach is by example. I have a strong belief in the power of collaboration and the importance of having a clear and open communication channel. I am always open to feedback and I believe that it is the best way to grow as a person and as a professional.

I thrive for a healthy work-life balance and I try to maintain a positive attitude towards my work and my team. I am always looking for ways to improve myself and my skills, and I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow.

I've become a fan of asynchronous culture due to the flexibility and productivity it provides. I think it improves knowledge sharing, transparency and inclusivity.

# My experience

## Freelance

> 2023

### Containerization and migration to AWS at [SZICOM](https://www.szicom.com.ar/)

After gaining a lot of Cloud experience, I did a job for SZICOM to help them with the migration of their infrastructure to AWS.

This involved primarily dockerization of the application, and then AWS resources like CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, ECS, ECR.

## Developer at [Okteto](https://www.okteto.com/)

> 2022-2024

### Backend Software Developer at [Okteto](https://www.okteto.com/)

I've worked on the backend team, developing a multi-service [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/) chart using `golang` and `Kubernetes`, and a CLI tool for interacting with the Okteto Platform.

Our Backend API was made using GraphQL technology,

In this time, I've learned a lot about Kubernetes in depth, by managing and creating resources such as CRDs, Operators, Controllers and Webhooks.

I've gotten to know better the container ecosystem by using `Docker` and `containerd` while working with `Buildkit` and `Kubernetes`.

I've also become very proficient in Golang, and I've got to know multiple packages such as `client-go` and `cobra`.

### Platform Infrastructure at [Okteto](https://www.okteto.com/)

Due to high demand, I moved to the infrastructure team to help with the development of the SaaS platform.

We used `Terraform` and `Terraform Cloud` with a lot of custom pipelines done with GitOps.

I've also became comfortable working with `Google Cloud Platform` services (where we had all our infra) and got to explore a bit of `AWS` and `Azure`.

#### Data Science member at [Héritas](https://heritas.com.ar/)

> 2021-2022

I had the incredible opportunity to work with a small and amazing team of data scientists, computer scientists and bioinformatics in a genetics based presicion medicine company.

Despite the name of the area and the specialties among the team, our responsibilites were many and diverse. We were like a swiss army knife, all tasks related to informatics were in our hands. That's why we were able to work with a lot of different technologies and languages such as:

- Sys Admin:
  - Docker
  - Server management (of our own servers with CentOS and Ubuntu)
  - Third party cloud service providers (Digital Ocean, Google Cloud)
- Programming languages:
  - Bash for running scripts and pipelines
  - Python
    - API connections
      - We took advantage of JIRA's issues workflow and took it to its limits to manage our process workflow.
    - Data analysis and manipulation with Pandas and Numpy
  - R along with its web framework, Shiny
    - We built all our main web apps using Shiny
    - Many packages for data analysis such as purr, pelt, peshape.
  - Latex and Markdown for writing and formatting documents
- `MongoDB` as our Non relational databases:
- Bioinformatics data representation
  - bcl, fasta/fastq, bam/cram, vcf
- Bioinformatics data processing manipulation
  - Multiple command tools to aid our propietary pipeline

I also developed and matured other more broad capabilities:

- I learned a lot about genomics and the standards for handling the digital data associated with it.
- Since our area was in the middle of the production process, I had to interact with different teams to understand the different processes and the different roles they had.
- I had to read and understand the documentation of the tools we used to process the data.
- I was in charge of the evolutionary maintainance of our apps, which was a complex task that nourished me in the process of learning and understanding. This sparked my interest in the micro-services architecture pattern which I'm still studying.

## Full Stack Web Developer at [SZICOM](https://www.szicom.com.ar/)

> 2019-2020

I was able to keep up with a team of Senior Developers with over 10 years of experience at [SZICOM](https://www.szicom.com.ar/). We developed the web app "Distribution Management System" for Naturgy (MX).

- Backend Development:
  - C#
  - Net Core
  - Entity Framework Core
  - SQL Server
  - Visual Studio
- Frontend Development:
  - Angular
  - HTML + CSS
  - TypeScript
  - JavaScript
  - Visual Studio Code
- Agile methodologies
- Unit and Integration Testing
- CI/CD
- Design Patterns
- Tools:
  - Atlassian Package (Jira, Confluence, BitBucket, SourceTree)
  - Jenkins
  - RabbitMQ
  - Robot Framework

## Educational Robotics Teacher

> 2018

I was a teacher at [Taller Big Bang](https://www.facebook.com/bigbangtaller/), which was a science institute for children where we taught 3 courses:

- Educational robotics with [LEGO Education](https://education.lego.com/en-us/)
  - LEGO WeDo (6-8 years)
  - LEGO Mindstorms (9-11 years)
- Video Game creation

# Self Learner

I have a passion for learning and I'm constantly studying and trying out new stuff. I don't have the time to journal all of them, so be sure to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/AgustinRamiroDiaz) if you are interested in seeing what I've been working on lately.

## Snake with local multiplayer

With my interest in `rust` and game development, I took a shot at building a [multiplayer snake game](https://github.com/AgustinRamiroDiaz/snake_bevy) with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/). I learned about the [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) framework and data oriented Rust

## QWorld Global Quantum Programming Workshop | [QBronze](https://qworld.lu.lv/index.php/workshop-bronze/)

Introductory level workshop series on the basics of quantum computing
and quantum programming using Jupyter notebooks.

The Bronze has five main sections

- Basics of classical systems (Probabilistic bits, coin-flipping, biased coins, probabilistic states, and probabilistic operators, correlation)
- Basics of quantum systems (Quantum programs as circuits: registers, gates, measurements, execution, and reading the outcomes, quantum state and operators)
- Quantum operators on a quantum bot
- Entanglement and basics quantum protocols
- Quantum search algorithm

## Artificial Intelligence

I've always been curious about AI, so I took open courses from Stanford, MIT, OpenAI, FastAI
using Pytorch and TensorFlow on topics such as Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning.
I'm familiar with various architectures (RNN, LSTM, Transformers, CNN, Generative Models such as VAE and GAN).

## Unity 3D

Created a simple infinite runner game using the [Unity3d](https://unity.com/) engine with `C#`.
I followed tutorials from [Brackeys](https://brackeys.com/) and [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/).
