# Who am I?

I am a software engineer with a passion for building things. I consider myself a fast learner and a team player. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow.

I am a big fan of open source and I'm looking forward to working with Rust and Kubernetes.

In my free time I like to do Acroyoga and Acroduo.

# Culture

I believe that the best way to learn is by doing, and the best way to teach is by example. I have a strong belief in the power of collaboration and the importance of having a clear and open communication channel. I am always open to feedback and I believe that it is the best way to grow as a person and as a professional.

I thrive for a healthy work-life balance and I try to maintain a positive attitude towards my work and my team. I am always looking for ways to improve myself and my skills, and for new challenges and opportunities to grow.

I've become a fan of asynchronous culture due to the flexibility and productivity it provides. I think it improves knowledge sharing, transparency and inclusivity.

# My experience

## Freelance

> 2024

### Containerization and migration to AWS at [SZICOM](https://www.szicom.com.ar/)

After gaining a lot of Cloud experience I've worked with SZICOM to help them with the migration of their infrastructure to AWS.

This involved primarily dockerization of their applications in `Dotnet` and `Angular`, and working with AWS resources like CodeBuild, CodePipeline, ECS, ECR, S3, Lambda, RDS, CloudWatch, CloudFormation, CloudFront, and IAM.

## Developer at [Okteto](https://www.okteto.com/)

> 2022-2024

### Platform Infrastructure at [Okteto](https://www.okteto.com/)

Due to high demand, I moved to the infrastructure team to help with the development of the SaaS platform with:

- `Terraform` and `Terraform Cloud` with a lot of custom pipelines done with GitOps to manage 20+ customer environments.
- `Google Cloud Platform` as our cloud provider
  - I was in charge of the Monitoring and Alerting project, where we used `AlertManager`, `Prometheus` and `Grafana`.

In this time I've learned a lot about the infrastructure side of `Kubernetes` and explored some popular helm charts like `NGINX`. I've also became very comfortable working with `Google Cloud Platform` services and got to explore a bit of `AWS` and `Azure`.

### Backend Software Developer at [Okteto](https://www.okteto.com/)

I've worked on the backend team

- developing a multi-service [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/)
- using `golang` to interact with `Kubernetes`
- [okteto CLI tool](https://github.com/okteto/okteto/) for interacting with the Okteto Platform and the `Kubernetes` cluster.
- backend API using `GraphQL`

In this time, I've learned a lot about Kubernetes in depth, by managing and creating resources such as `CRDs`, `Operators`, `Controllers` and `Webhooks`.

I've gotten to know better the container ecosystem by using `Docker` and `containerd` while working with `Buildkit` and `Kubernetes`.

I've also improved my craft as a developer with `golang`, learning about its design patterns and the its "idiomatic" path. I've got to work with some famous packages such as `client-go`, `cobra` and `require`.

## Data Science member at [Héritas](https://heritas.com.ar/)

> 2021-2022

I had the opportunity to work with a small and amazing team of data scientists, computer scientists and bioinformatics in a genetics based presicion medicine company.

I got to work in many areas and with many tooling:

- Sys Admin:
  - Containerization with `docker`
  - Server management (of our own servers with CentOS and Ubuntu)
  - Third party cloud service providers (Digital Ocean, Google Cloud)
- Programming languages:
  - Scripting in `bash`
  - `python`
    - We took advantage of JIRA's issues workflow and took it to its limits through the web API to manage our process workflow.
    - Data analysis and manipulation with `pandas` and `numpy`
  - `R`
    - `shiny` web framework
    - Packages for data analysis such as `purr`, `pelt`, `peshape`
  - `Latex` and `markdown` for writing and formatting documents
- `mongoDB` as our non relational database

I learned a lot about genomics and the standards for handling the digital data associated with it, such as `bcl`, `fasta/fastq`, `bam/cram`, `vcf` and cli tools to manipulate them like the one from [Illumina](https://www.illumina.com/).

Since our area was in the middle of the production process, I had to interact with different teams to understand the different processes and the different roles they had.

## Full Stack Web Developer at [SZICOM](https://www.szicom.com.ar/)

> 2019-2020

I was able to keep up with a team of Senior Developers with over 10 years of experience at [SZICOM](https://www.szicom.com.ar/). We developed the web app "Distribution Management System" for Naturgy (MX).

- Backend Development:
  - `C#` with `.Net Core`
  - Entity Framework Core
  - SQL Server
  - Visual Studio
- Frontend Development:
  - `Angular` with `HTML` and `CSS`
  - `typeScript` + `javaScript`
  - Visual Studio Code
- Agile methodologies
- Unit and Integration Testing
- CI/CD
- Design Patterns
- Event systems architecture with `RabbitMQ`
- Tools:
  - Atlassian Package (Jira, Confluence, BitBucket, SourceTree)
  - Jenkins
  - Robot Framework for UI end to end testing

## Educational Robotics Teacher

> 2018

I was a teacher at [Taller Big Bang](https://www.facebook.com/bigbangtaller/), which was a science institute for children where we taught 3 courses:

- Educational robotics with [LEGO Education](https://education.lego.com/en-us/)
  - LEGO WeDo (6-8 years)
  - LEGO Mindstorms (9-11 years)
- Video Game creation

# Self Learner

I have a passion for learning and I'm constantly studying and trying out new stuff. I don't have the time to journal all of them, so be sure to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/AgustinRamiroDiaz) if you are interested in seeing what I've been working on lately.

## Snake with local multiplayer

With my interest in `rust` and game development, I took a shot at building a [multiplayer snake game](https://github.com/AgustinRamiroDiaz/snake_bevy) with [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/). I learned about the [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) framework and data oriented Rust

## QWorld Global Quantum Programming Workshop | [QBronze](https://qworld.lu.lv/index.php/workshop-bronze/)

Introductory level workshop series on the basics of quantum computing
and quantum programming using Jupyter notebooks.

The Bronze has five main sections

- Basics of classical systems (Probabilistic bits, coin-flipping, biased coins, probabilistic states, and probabilistic operators, correlation)
- Basics of quantum systems (Quantum programs as circuits: registers, gates, measurements, execution, and reading the outcomes, quantum state and operators)
- Quantum operators on a quantum bot
- Entanglement and basics quantum protocols
- Quantum search algorithm

## Artificial Intelligence

I've always been curious about AI, so I took open courses from Stanford, MIT, OpenAI, FastAI
using Pytorch and TensorFlow on topics such as Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning.
I'm familiar with various architectures (RNN, LSTM, Transformers, CNN, Generative Models such as VAE and GAN).

## Unity 3D

Created a simple infinite runner game using the [Unity3d](https://unity.com/) engine with `C#`.
I followed tutorials from [Brackeys](https://brackeys.com/) and [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/).
